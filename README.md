# MyContract â€“ Simple String Storage in Solidity

This project contains a basic example of a Solidity smart contract that stores a string on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to demonstrate how public state variables and simple update functions work in smart contracts.

## ðŸ”§ Contract Details

The contract defines a single public string variable called `ourString`, which is initialized with `"Hello World"`. The value can be updated by calling the `updateOurString()` function with a new string.
