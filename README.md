# Solidity Learning Repository 🧠

This repository contains a collection of smart contracts written in Solidity. Each contract is focused on demonstrating specific features of the language and is documented for clarity and future reference.

## 📁 Contracts

| Contract            | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `MyContract.sol`     | A simple example of storing and updating a string. |
| *(More coming soon)* | Add your next contracts here...            |

All source files are located in the [`/contracts`](./contracts/) directory.

## 🧪 How to Use (Remix IDE)

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file and paste the contents of any `.sol` file from this repo
3. Compile the contract (e.g., with Solidity v0.8.14)
4. Deploy and interact using the JavaScript VM

## ✍️ Conventions

- Contracts are written using Solidity `^0.8.x`
- Each file includes inline documentation and comments
- Function and variable names follow camelCase
- Only core language features are used (no external libraries for now)
